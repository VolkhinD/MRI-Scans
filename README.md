# MRI-Scans

In this project,I aim to develop an advanced deep learning model for the automatic segmentation of the stomach and intestines in MRI scans of cancer patients. The dataset utilized for this research has been sourced from Kaggle, comprising MRI scans obtained from actual cancer patients who underwent 1-5 scans on separate days during their radiation treatment. The primary objective is to create a robust algorithm that can provide precise segmentation of three crucial components of the digestive system: ***the large bowel, small bowel, and stomach.***

**Multi-Class Segmentation:** The segmentation task involves identifying and delineating three distinct components within each MRI scan. The model needs to learn the intricate features and patterns that differentiate the large bowel, small bowel, and stomach,
